We're proud to announce the release of Hobo 2.1.0 with Rails 4 support!

Take a look at the [Download and Installation Instructions](/tutorials/two-minutes).

Many of the changes required in upgrading a Hobo 2.0 application are necessitated by the switch from Rails 3.2 to 4.0.  [Railscasts has a good guide to upgrading to Rails 4.0](http://railscasts.com/episodes/415-upgrading-to-rails-4).

From Hobo's point of view, you shouldn't need to change almost anything :).

## Gemfile

Now Hobo uses "will_paginate_hobo" gem, instead of the git repository "git://github.com/Hobo/will_paginate.git". This should make it easier to install in systems without Git installed (users have reported problems with Windows and Git).

You also need to add the `protected_attributes` gem to your Gemfile.


# Internal changes

In order to make Hobo compatible with Rails 4, these are the main changes that have been done:

## Routing

* `url_for` does not accept parameters any more
* Remove deprecated routes system
* `match` is no longer accepted in routes.rb, it has been replaced by "get" and "post"

## ActiveRecord

* `Model.find(:all)` is deprecated
* `finder.scoped :conditions => conditions` has been replaced with `finder.where(conditions)`
* raise_on_type_mismatch has been renamed to raise_on_type_mismatch!

## Other
* `protected_attributes` gem has been added to support the "old" way of protecting attributes
* Domizio has made Hobo thread safe :)
* Hobo's custom `will_paginate` has been packaged into the `hobo_will_paginate` gem. This should make possible to install Hobo without Git (it seems to be a bit hard under Windows).## Installation
